- **Members**: Manage library members and their details.
- **Librarians**: Handle librarian accounts.
- **Borrowing Records**: Track book loans and returns.
- **Payments**: Manage fines and fees.

## Challenges & Learning
This project helped in understanding Spring Boot development, especially JPA, REST APIs, and MySQL integration. Some challenges included handling optimistic locking issues, transaction management, and fixing repository errors. Moving forward, improvements can be made in performance optimization, caching strategies, and implementing JWT authentication for security.
